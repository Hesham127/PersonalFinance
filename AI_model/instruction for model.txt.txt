Extract receipt data in Python.

Convert the extracted information into JSON.

Send a POST request to your Spring Boot backend.

Spring Boot receives the JSON and stores it in MySQL (your schema with transactions, receipts, receipt_items).

I can modify your Python code to:

Parse text for store name, date, total, items (basic extraction).

Send the data via HTTP POST to Spring Boot.
Key Points:

Parsing:

Total amount, receipt date, store name, and items are extracted using regex.

You can improve this with more advanced NLP for messy receipts.

Sending to Spring Boot:

The data dictionary is converted to JSON.

A POST request is sent to http://localhost:8080/api/receipts.

Spring Boot backend:

You need a REST controller like:

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/receipts")
public class ReceiptController {

    @Autowired
    private ReceiptService receiptService;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Receipt> createReceipt(@RequestBody ReceiptDTO dto) {
        Receipt receipt = receiptService.saveReceiptFromDTO(dto);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(receipt);
    }
}
